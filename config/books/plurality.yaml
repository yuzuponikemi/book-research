  work_description: >
    "Plurality" (2024) by Audrey Tang and E. Glen Weyl is a manifesto for collaborative
    technology and democracy. It proposes that digital tools can bridge social differences
    and strengthen democratic institutions through mechanisms like Quadratic Voting,
    digital deliberation platforms (Polis, vTaiwan), and new approaches to identity,
    property, and governance in the digital age.
  analysis_guidance: >
    Pay attention to: the philosophical foundations drawing from Henry George, John Dewey,
    and Danielle Allen; the concrete mechanisms (QV, QF, Polis); the Taiwan digital democracy
    experiments; the tension between individual rights and collective coordination;
    and the vision for technology serving democracy rather than undermining it.
